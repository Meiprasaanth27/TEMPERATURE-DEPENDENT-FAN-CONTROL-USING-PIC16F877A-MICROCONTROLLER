# TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT-FAN-CONTROL-USING-PIC16F877A-MICROCONTROLLER
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a temperature-dependent fan control system implemented on the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The project aims to regulate the speed of a fan based on the surrounding temperature, providing an efficient and automated cooling solution.
